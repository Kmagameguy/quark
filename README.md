Personal collection of userChrome tweaks to trim down Firefox Quantum's bloated UI. Great for power users -- these tweaks remove most UI elements that already have keyboard shortcuts or menu items. 
  
Original styling and inspiration borrowed from user GiantSpeck on Reddit:  
[My Two-Line Firefox Setup - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7ftsb6/my_twoline_firefox_setup/)

## Installation
1. Create a "Chrome" folder inside your Firefox profile directory  
1. Download and place the userChrome.css file from this repo into the "Chrome" folder
1. Restart Firefox

## June 2022 Update
Keeping up with the breaking changes Mozilla keeps making has been difficult.  Over time these tweaks have
become more relaxed, favoring a two-line setup instead of the original one-line setup that had tabs + navbar side-by-side.  
  
For now this works for me but I may try to do a one-line setup again in the future, time permitting.

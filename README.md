# Quark 
Personal collection of userChrome tweaks to trim down Firefox Quantum's bloated UI. Great for small form-factor screens like the 13" Macbook Pro, these tweaks remove most UI elements that already have keyboard shortcuts or menu items. Other elements are hidden until they are contextually relevant.  
  
Original styling and inspiration borrowed from user GiantSpeck on Reddit with additional changes borrowed from lr-tech:  
[My Two-Line Firefox Setup - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7ftsb6/my_twoline_firefox_setup/)
